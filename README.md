# Creatures (in python :D)

I like programming creatures. I want them to behave by themselves.

Not really much to see yet.

## Running

Use a virtualenv, then `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then try loading a scenario from `world.yaml` and generate 200 frames, plotting it live: `python load.py world.yaml 200`

Thats about it.
